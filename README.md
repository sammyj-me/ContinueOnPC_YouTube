A continue on PC app for YouTube

Have you ever wanted to send YouTube videos or other webpages from your phone to open directly on your computer?

Setup Steps:
1. Download this code to your local file directory.
2. Install necessary python libs.
3. Fill out your email and phone number in the code.
        - it's recommended to create a separate email to process all the links you'll send.
4. Change email permissions to allow access *For Less Secure Apps* so the python script can log in to your email of choice.
