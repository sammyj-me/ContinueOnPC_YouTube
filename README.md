A continue on PC app for YouTube

Have you ever wanted to open YouTube videos from your phone to your computer?

Setup Steps:
1. Download this code
2. Install necessary python libs
3a. Fill out your email and phone number in the code
3b. Change email permissions to lessen security so the python script can log in to your email of choice
  - it's recommended to create a separate email to process all the links you'll send.
4. Change autoplay permissions in your browser
5. Run the code!
  - (optional): Run this code in the background if you don't want to keep the python shell terminal open.
  
  Enjoy!
