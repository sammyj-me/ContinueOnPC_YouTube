A continue on PC app for YouTube

Have you ever wanted to send YouTube videos or other webpages from your phone to open directly on your computer?

Setup Steps:
1. Download this code to your local PC
2. Install necessary python libs
3. Fill out your email and phone number in the code
4. Change email permissions to lessen security so the python script can log in to your email of choice
    - it's recommended to create a separate email to process all the links you'll send.
5. Change autoplay permissions in your browser
6. Run the code!
    - (optional): Run this code in the background if you don't want to keep the python shell terminal open.

7. Watch this YouTube video for a code walk-through

  Enjoy!
